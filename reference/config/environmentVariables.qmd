Viash checks several environment variables during operation.

## VIASH_HOME

**Type**: `String`

If `VIASH_HOME` is not defined, the fallback `HOME`/.viash is used.

Location where specific downloaded versions of Viash will be cached and run from.


## VIASH_VERSION

**Type**: `String`

**Default**: `Empty`

A specific Viash version can be set to run the commands with. If so required, the specific Viash version will be downloaded.
This is useful when replicating older results or building Viash components that use outdated code.


**Example:**

```sh
VIASH_VERSION=0.7.0 viash ns build
```
