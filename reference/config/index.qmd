A Viash configuration is a YAML file which contains metadata to describe the behaviour and build target(s) of a component.  
We commonly name this file `config.vsh.yaml` in our examples, but you can name it however you choose.  


**Example:**

```yaml
functionality:
  name: hello_world
  arguments:
    - type: string
      name: --input
      default: "world"
  resources:
    - type: bash_script
      path: script.sh
      text: echo Hello $par_input
runners:
  - type: executable
engines:
  - type: docker
    image: "bash:4.0"

```

## \_\_merge\_\_

**Type**: `File`

**Default**: `Empty`

Config inheritance by including YAML partials. This is useful for defining common APIs in
separate files. `__merge__` can be used in any level of the YAML. For example,
not just in the config but also in the functionality or any of the engines.


**Example:**

```yaml
__merge__: ../api/common_interface.yaml
```

## engines

**Type**: `List of Engine`

A list of engine environments to execute target artifacts in.

 - [NativeEngine](/reference/config/engines/native/#)
 - [DockerEngine](/reference/config/engines/docker/#)


## functionality

**Type**: `Functionality`

The [functionality](/reference/config/functionality/#) describes the behaviour of the script in terms of arguments and resources.
By specifying a few restrictions (e.g. mandatory arguments) and adding some descriptions, Viash will automatically generate a stylish command-line interface for you.


## platforms

**Type**: `List of Platform`

::: {.callout-warning}
Deprecated since 0.8.0. Planned removal at 0.9.0. Use 'engines' and 'runners' instead.
:::
A list of platforms to generate target artifacts for.

 - [Native](/reference/config/platforms/native/#)
 - [Docker](/reference/config/platforms/docker/#)
 - [Nextflow](/reference/config/platforms/nextflow/#)


## runners

**Type**: `List of Runner`

A list of runners to execute target artifacts.
