A Viash configuration is a YAML file which contains metadata to describe the behaviour and build target(s) of a component.  
We commonly name this file `config.vsh.yaml` in our examples, but you can name it however you choose.  


**Example:**

```yaml
functionality:
  name: hello_world
  arguments:
    - type: string
      name: --input
      default: "world"
  resources:
    - type: bash_script
      path: script.sh
      text: echo Hello $par_input
platforms:
  - type: docker
    image: "bash:4.0"

```

## \_\_merge\_\_

**Type**: `File`

**Default**: `Empty`

Config inheritance by including YAML partials. This is useful for defining common APIs in
separate files. `__merge__` can be used in any level of the YAML. For example,
not just in the config but also in the functionality or any of the platforms.


**Example:**

```yaml
__merge__: ../api/common_interface.yaml
```

## functionality

**Type**: `Functionality`

The [functionality](/reference/config/functionality/#) describes the behaviour of the script in terms of arguments and resources.
By specifying a few restrictions (e.g. mandatory arguments) and adding some descriptions, Viash will automatically generate a stylish command-line interface for you.


## platforms

**Type**: `List of Platform`

A list of platforms to generate target artifacts for.
