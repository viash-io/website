Directives are optional settings that affect the execution of the process.


**Example:**

```yaml
directives:
    container: rocker/r-ver:4.1
    label: highcpu
    cpus: 4
    memory: 16 GB
```

## accelerator

**Type**: `Map of String to String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `accelerator` directive allows you to specify the hardware accelerator requirement for the task execution e.g. GPU processor.

Viash implements this directive as a map with accepted keywords: `type`, `limit`, `request`, and `runtime`.

See [`accelerator`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#accelerator).


**Example:**

```yaml
[ limit: 4, type: "nvidia-tesla-k80" ]
```

## afterScript

**Type**: `String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `afterScript` directive allows you to execute a custom (Bash) snippet immediately after the main process has run. This may be useful to clean up your staging area.

See [`afterScript`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#afterscript).


**Example:**

```yaml
source /cluster/bin/cleanup
```

## beforeScript

**Type**: `String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `beforeScript` directive allows you to execute a custom (Bash) snippet before the main process script is run. This may be useful to initialise the underlying cluster environment or for other custom initialisation.

See [`beforeScript`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#beforeScript).


**Example:**

```yaml
source /cluster/bin/setup
```

## cache

**Type**: `Either
  - Boolean
  - String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `cache` directive allows you to store the process results to a local cache. When the cache is enabled and the pipeline is launched with the resume option, any following attempt to execute the process, along with the same inputs, will cause the process execution to be skipped, producing the stored data as the actual results.

The caching feature generates a unique key by indexing the process script and inputs. This key is used to identify univocally the outputs produced by the process execution.

The `cache` is enabled by default, you can disable it for a specific process by setting the cache directive to `false`.

Accepted values are: `true`, `false`, `"deep"`, and `"lenient"`.

See [`cache`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#cache).


**Examples:**

```yaml
true
```

```yaml
false
```

```yaml
"deep"
```

```yaml
"lenient"
```

## conda

**Type**: `String` / `List of String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `conda` directive allows for the definition of the process dependencies using the Conda package manager.

Nextflow automatically sets up an environment for the given package names listed by in the `conda` directive.

See [`conda`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#conda).


**Examples:**

```yaml
"bwa=0.7.15"
```

```yaml
"bwa=0.7.15 fastqc=0.11.5"
```

```yaml
["bwa=0.7.15", "fastqc=0.11.5"]
```

## container

**Type**: `Either
  - Map of String to String
  - String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `container` directive allows you to execute the process script in a Docker container.

It requires the Docker daemon to be running in machine where the pipeline is executed, i.e. the local machine when using the local executor or the cluster nodes when the pipeline is deployed through a grid executor.

Viash implements allows either a string value or a map. In case a map is used, the allowed keys are: `registry`, `image`, and `tag`. The `image` value must be specified.

See [`container`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#container).


**Examples:**

```yaml
"foo/bar:tag"
```

This is transformed to `"reg/im:ta"`:

```yaml
[ registry: "reg", image: "im", tag: "ta" ]
```

This is transformed to `"im:latest"`:

```yaml
[ image: "im" ]
```

## containerOptions

**Type**: `String` / `List of String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `containerOptions` directive allows you to specify any container execution option supported by the underlying container engine (ie. Docker, Singularity, etc). This can be useful to provide container settings only for a specific process e.g. mount a custom path.

See [`containerOptions`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#containeroptions).


**Examples:**

```yaml
"--foo bar"
```

```yaml
["--foo bar", "-f b"]
```

## cpus

**Type**: `Either
  - Int
  - String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `cpus` directive allows you to define the number of (logical) CPU required by the process' task.

See [`cpus`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#cpus).


**Examples:**

```yaml
1
```

```yaml
10
```

## disk

**Type**: `String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `disk` directive allows you to define how much local disk storage the process is allowed to use.

See [`disk`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#disk).


**Examples:**

```yaml
"1 GB"
```

```yaml
"2TB"
```

```yaml
"3.2KB"
```

```yaml
"10.B"
```

## echo

**Type**: `Either
  - Boolean
  - String`

**Default**: `Empty`

By default the stdout produced by the commands executed in all processes is ignored. By setting the `echo` directive to true, you can forward the process stdout to the current top running process stdout file, showing it in the shell terminal.
 
See [`echo`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#echo).


**Examples:**

```yaml
true
```

```yaml
false
```

## errorStrategy

**Type**: `String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `errorStrategy` directive allows you to define how an error condition is managed by the process. By default when an error status is returned by the executed script, the process stops immediately. This in turn forces the entire pipeline to terminate.

Table of available error strategies:
| Name | Executor |
|------|----------|
| `terminate` | Terminates the execution as soon as an error condition is reported. Pending jobs are killed (default) |
| `finish` | Initiates an orderly pipeline shutdown when an error condition is raised, waiting the completion of any submitted job. |
| `ignore` | Ignores processes execution errors. |
| `retry` | Re-submit for execution a process returning an error condition. |

See [`errorStrategy`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#errorstrategy).


**Examples:**

```yaml
"terminate"
```

```yaml
"finish"
```

## executor

**Type**: `String`

**Default**: `Empty`

The `executor` defines the underlying system where processes are executed. By default a process uses the executor defined globally in the nextflow.config file.

The `executor` directive allows you to configure what executor has to be used by the process, overriding the default configuration. The following values can be used:

| Name | Executor |
