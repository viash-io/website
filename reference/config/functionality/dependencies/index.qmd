  repository: 
    type: github
    uri: openpipelines-bio/modules
    tag: 0.3.0

```

Definition of a dependency with a repository using sugar syntax.

```yaml
name: qc/multiqc
repository: "github://openpipelines-bio/modules:0.3.0"

```

Definition of a dependency with a repository defined as 'openpipelines-bio' under `.functionality.repositories`.

```yaml
name: qc/multiqc

```

## alias
