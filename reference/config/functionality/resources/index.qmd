Resources are files that support the component. The first resource should be [a script](/guide/component/create-component.html#create-a-script) that will be executed when the functionality is run. Additional resources will be copied to the same directory.

Common properties:

 * type: `file` / `r_script` / `python_script` / `bash_script` / `javascript_script` / `scala_script` / `csharp_script`, specifies the type of the resource. The first resource cannot be of type `file`. When the type is not specified, the default type is simply `file`.
 * dest: filename, the resulting name of the resource.  From within a script, the file can be accessed at `meta["resources_dir"] + "/" + dest`. If unspecified, `dest` will be set to the basename of the `path` parameter.
 * path: `path/to/file`, the path of the input file. Can be a relative or an absolute path, or a URI. Mutually exclusive with `text`.
 * text: ...multiline text..., the content of the resulting file specified as a string. Mutually exclusive with `path`.
 * is_executable: `true` / `false`, whether the resulting resource file should be made executable.


**Example:**

```yaml
resources:
  - type: r_script
    path: script.R
  - type: file
    path: resource1.txt

```
