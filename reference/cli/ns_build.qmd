Build a namespace from many viash config files.

**Usage:**

`viash ns build [-n nmspc] [-s src] [-t target] [-p docker] [--setup] [--push] [--parallel] [--flatten]`

| Argument | Description | Type |
|-|:----|-:
| `config` | Filter which component get selected by specifying the config path. | `String` |
| `--config_mod`, `-c` | Modify a viash config at runtime using [dynamic config modding](/reference/config_mods/#). | `List[String]` |
| `--engine` | Acts as a regular expression to filter the engine ids specified in the found config files. If this is not provided, all engines will be used. If no engines are defined in a config, the native engine will be used. | `String` |
| `--flatten`, `-f` | Flatten the target builds, handy for building one runner/engine to a bin directory. | `Boolean` |
| `--parallel`, `-l` | Whether or not to run the process in parallel. | `Boolean` |
| `--platform`, `-p` | Deprecated. Use --runner and --engine instead. Acts as a regular expression to filter the platform ids specified in the found config files. If this is not provided, all platforms will be used. If no platforms are defined in a config, the native platform will be used. In addition, the path to a platform yaml file can also be specified. | `String` |
| `--push` | Whether or not to push the container to a Docker registry [Docker Engine only]. | `Boolean` |
| `--query`, `-q` | Filter which components get selected by component and [namespace](/guide/project/structure.html#grouping-components-in-namespaces) name. Can be a regex. Example: "^mynamespace/component1\$". | `String` |
| `--query_name` | Filter which components get selected by component name. Can be a regex. Example: "^component1". | `String` |
| `--query_namespace`, `-n` | Filter which namespaces get selected by [namespace](/guide/project/structure.html#grouping-components-in-namespaces) name. Can be a regex. Example: "^mynamespace\$". | `String` |
| `--runner` | Acts as a regular expression to filter the runner ids specified in the found config files. If this is not provided, all runners will be used. If no runners are defined in a config, the executable runner will be used. | `String` |
| `--setup` | Which [setup strategy](/guide/component/add-dependencies.html#step-3-rebuild-docker-image) for creating the container to use [Docker Engine only]. | `String` |
| `--src`, `-s` | A source directory containing viash config files, possibly structured in a hierarchical folder structure. Default: src/. | `String` |
| `--target`, `-t` | A target directory to build the executables into. Default: target/. | `String` |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help message |  |
