---

As bioinformatics workflows become increasingly complex, choosing the right workflow management platform is critical for research success. Viash represents a new generation of workflow tools, but how does it compare to established platforms like Nextflow and Snakemake?

To answer this question objectively, we evaluated 16 major workflow management systems across the dimensions that matter most for computational biology. The results show that **Viash + Nextflow consistently outperforms other platforms** in the areas critical for modern research workflows.

# Nextflow Evolution: Power of Using Viash for Nextflow 

Nextflow has earned its popularity through **excellent portability and scalability** that remain consistent across all its dialects. However, as workflows become more complex, other architectural challenges such as expressiveness and modularity become critical. **Viash adresses these architectural gaps** while preserving everything that makes Nextflow powerful. Here's how different Nextflow approaches compare:


|  | DSL1 | DSL2 | nf-core | VDSL3 |
| Tool | Nextflow | Nextflow | Nextflow + Groovy | Nextflow + Viash |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|

## How We Compared Platforms
Comprehensive Evaluation: We assessed 16 workflow platforms across 8 critical dimensions using documented evidence from official sources, code repositories, and community resources. Each platform was scored based on real capabilities rather than marketing claims.

Focus on What Matters: Our evaluation prioritized the practical needs of bioinformatics teams: ease of adoption, long-term maintainability, scalability requirements, and ecosystem maturity.

## What We Evaluated
We focused on eight dimensions that directly impact your success with workflow platforms:

**Ease of Use**: Learning curve, syntax complexity, setup requirements, and debugging capabilities. Platforms with intuitive interfaces and clear error messages score higher.
**Expressiveness**: Ability to represent complex computational patterns, conditional execution, dynamic workflows, and advanced control flow structures.
**Modularity**: Component encapsulation, reusability across workflows, well-defined interfaces, dependency management, and versioning support.
**Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between tool definition, workflow logic, configuration, and execution environments.
**Portability**: Support for diverse compute platforms (cloud, HPC, local), containerization technologies, and storage solutions.
**Scalability**: Distributed execution capabilities, resource management, performance monitoring, and handling of large-scale workflows.
**Learning Resources**: Documentation quality, tutorial availability, example workflows, and community support channels.
**Pipeline Initiatives**: Curated pipeline collections, community-driven initiatives, and standardized workflow templates.
