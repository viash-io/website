## What's new?

Allow generating placeholder without VIASH START/VIASH END blocks.

A script does not need to contain a `VIASH START`/`VIASH END` block in order to function.

Previously, each script had to contain a codeblock as follows:

  ```r
  ## VIASH START
  par <- list(
    input = "foo",
    output = "bar
  )
  ## VIASH END
  ```

## Full changelog

### MINOR CHANGES

* Allow generating placeholder without VIASH START/VIASH END blocks.

### BUG FIXES

* `viash ns build`: Some platforms would sometimes not be detected.
* `viash run`: Avoid error when no arguments need to be chowned.
