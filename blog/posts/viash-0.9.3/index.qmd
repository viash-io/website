## What's new?

The upcoming release of Nextflow introduces a new class for loading scripts and renamed the old class.
This release supports this change by using reflection to detect the available class.

## Full changelog

### BUG FIXES

* `NextflowRunner`: ScriptParser was renamed to ScriptLoaderV1 in Nextflow 25.02.0-edge (PR #812). This fix uses reflection
  to detect whether ScriptParser exists -- if not the ScriptLoaderFactory is used instead.

* `NextflowRunner`: Make sure scripts are generated with the right extension (PR #815).
