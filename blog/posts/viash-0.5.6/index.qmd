## What's new?

* Viash can now be installed without Docker needing to be installed on your system. You do need `unzip` and `wget` to complete the installation.
* The Docker related messages are more user friendly now.

## Full changelog

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `BashWrapper`: Forbidden flags `-v`, `--verbose`, `--verbosity` have been renamed to `---v`, `---verbose`, `---verbosity`.

### MINOR CHANGES

* Set version of helper scripts to the same version as Viash.

* `DockerPlatform`: Produce helpful warning message when Docker image can't be found remotely (#94).

* `DockerPlatform`: Produce helpful error message when Docker isn't installed or the daemon is not running (#94 bis).

### BUG FIXES

* `viash_install`:
  - Passing Viash path as a string instead of as a file to ensure the path is not converted to an absolute path
  - Switch from Docker backend to a Native backend, 'unzip' and 'wget' are required.
  - Correctly set the log file for viash_test.
  
* `DockerPlatform`: Added sleep workaround to avoid concurrency issue where a file is executed to
  build docker containers but apparently still in the process of being written.
  
* `DockerPlatform`: Fix order issue of ---verbose flag in combination with ---setup, allowing to run 
  `viash run config.vsh.yaml -- ---setup cb ---verbose` and actually get output.
