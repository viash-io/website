## What's new?

The biggest change in this release is that long running Viash components (VS Code server or R Studio server for example) can now be interrupted by pressing CTRL-C or by sending it an `INT` or `SIGINT` signal. Before this release, you had to manually stop the Docker container to get the component to terminate.

## Full changelog

### NEW FEATURES

* `viash run`: A long running Viash component can be interrupted by pressing 
  CTRL-C or by sending it an `INT` or `SIGINT` signal.

* `DockerPlatform`: Automatically add a few labels based on metadata to Dockerfile.

* `DockerPlatform`: Added value `target_image_source` for setting the source of 
  the target image. This is used for defining labels in the dockerfile.
  Example:
  ```yaml
  target_image_source: https://github.com/foo/bar
  ```

### MINOR CHANGES

* `viash ns list`: Added `--format yaml/json` argument to be able to return the
  output as a json as well. Useful for when `jq` is installed but `yq` is not. Example:
  ```
    viash ns list -p docker -f json | jq '.[] | .info.config'
  ```

* `viash config view`: Same as above.

### DEPRECATION

* `CLI`: Deprecated `-P` flag use `-p` intead.

* `DockerPlatform`: Deprecated `version` value.
