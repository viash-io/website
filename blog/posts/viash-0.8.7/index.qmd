## What's new?

The upcoming release of Nextflow introduces a new class for loading scripts and renamed the old class.
This release supports this change by using reflection to detect the available class.

## Full changelog

### BUG FIXES

* `viash build`: Fix error handling of non-generic errors in the build process or while pushing docker containers (PR #696).

* `NextflowRunner`: ScriptParser was renamed to ScriptLoaderV1 in Nextflow 25.02.0-edge (PR #817). Backport from Viash 0.9.3 (PR #812).
  This fix uses reflection to detect whether ScriptParser exists -- if not the ScriptLoaderFactory is used instead.

* `NextflowRunner`: Backport path handling for `meta.resources_dir` for when symlinks are used (PR #817).
