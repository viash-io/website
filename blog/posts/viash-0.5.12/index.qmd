## What's new?

This release contains a bunch improvements for VDSL3 and adds some parameters to the `viash test` and `viash test ns` commands.

## Full changelog

### MINOR CHANGES

* `--help`: Don't print "my_component <not versioned>" when no version is specified, 
  but instead simply "my_component".

* `NextflowVdsl3Platform`: Set `mode=copy` for `auto.publish` and `auto.transcript`.

* `NextflowVdsl3Platform`: When a module is used multiple times in the same workflow, 
  don't throw an error anymore, instead simply generate a warning.

* `NextflowVdsl3Platform`: Throw an error when an input file was not found.

* `viash build`: Indent auto-generated code according the indentation of `VIASH START` when found.
  
* `Main`: Handle not finding the config file or resources in a config file better.
  Display a more helpful message instead of a stack trace.

* `BashWrapper`: Add checks on parameters for valid integer, double and boolean values.

* `BashWrapper`: Add option to limit string and integer values to specific choice values.

* `BashWrapper`: Add option to set min and max values for integer and double values.

* Dependencies:
  - Scala was upgraded from 2.12.10 to 2.12.15
  - sbt was upgraded from 1.3.4 to 1.6.1
  - sbt-scoverage was upgraded from 1.5.1 to 1.9.3

### BUG FIXES

* `viash_test`: Add back `--no_cache` parameter to `viash_test`.

* `viash_test`: Fix `--append` parameter for `viash_test`, was not getting passed through.

* `viash ns test`: Fix `--append` parameter, actually start from a clean file if append is false.

* `viash_push`: Fix component not being built during a release of Viash.

* `PythonRequirements`: Fix packages being mentioned twice in a Dockerfile.

* `Main`: Added support spaces in filenames of config files and resources

* `BashWrapper`: Display a message when the last parsed argument would require more values than are still available.
  Now display a message that values are missing, used to silently crash the wrapper.

* `viash config inject`: Fix error when file argument is `must_exist: true`.
