## What's new?

Fix building components with dependencies that have symlinks in their paths.

## Full changelog

### BUG FIXES

* `dependencies`: Fix dependencies with paths using symlinks (PR #621). The resolution for the `.build.vsh` was changed to use the `toRealPath` previously, so dependency resolution must take account possible resolved symlinks too.
