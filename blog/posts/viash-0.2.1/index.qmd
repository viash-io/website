## What's new?

### Docker chown by default

Running a script using a Docker platform will now chown output files by default, as well as any temporary files. You can turn off this feature by specifying `chown: false` in the yaml of a Docker platform.

### [NXF] Data references

Data references in Map form can now have values being lists. In other words, we can have multiple options which have one or more values.

### viash ns build -P docker --parallel --setup

`viash ns build` has been greatly improved! You can automatically build the docker container by adding `--setup` to the command, as well as make the whole thing run in parallel using the `--parallel` or `-l` flag.

To build a docker container, you can run either of the following:

  ```bash
  viash run -f path/to/config.yaml -P docker -- ---setup
  viash build -f path/to/functionality.yaml -P docker -o target/docker/path/to --setup
  ```

Note that the first will only build the docker container, whereas the second will build the executable and then build the docker container.

To build a lot of them all at once, run:

  ```bash
  viash ns build -P docker --parallel --setup
  ```

### Custom order of platform requirements

You can now choose the order in which platform requirements are installed!

Before:

  ```yaml
  type: docker
  image: rocker/tidyverse
  target_image: "viash_test/r"
  r:
    cran:
    - optparse
    github:
    - dynverse/dynutils@devel
    bioc:
    - limma
  apt:
    packages:
    - libhdf5-serial-dev
  docker:
    build_arg:
    - GITHUB_PAT="$GITHUB_PAT"
    run:
    - git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash_docs.git && rm -r viash_docs/.git
  â†‘ in which order will these three components be run? Who knows!
  ```

Now:

  ```yaml
  type: docker
  image: rocker/tidyverse
  target_image: "viash_test/r"
  setup:
  - type: docker
    build_arg:
    - GITHUB_PAT="$GITHUB_PAT"
  - type: apt
    packages:
    - libhdf5-serial-dev
  - type: r
    cran:
    - optparse
    - dynutils
    github:
    - rcannood/princurve@devel
    bioc:
    - limma
  - type: docker
    run:
    - git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash_docs.git && rm -r viash_docs/.git
  ```

This will ensure that the setup instructions are installed in the given order.
