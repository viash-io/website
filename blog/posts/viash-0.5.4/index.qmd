## What's new?

A cache type can now be specified in the config file for the Nextflow platform. Previously this was hardcoded to be `deep`, but the default caching method is now `default`.  
To use deep caching again, add this to your config file:

  ```yaml
  cache: deep
  ```

## Full changelog

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `NextflowPlatform`: The default caching mechanism is now what Nextflow uses as default. In order to replicate earlier
  caching, `cache: deep` should be specified in the Viash config file.

### NEW FEATURES

* `NextflowPlatform`: Added `cache` directive to specify the typing of caching to be performed.
