## What's new?

Examples for arguments now need to be of the same type as the argument itself. You can't provide an `integer` for a `string`-based argument for example.  
A handy new command has been added: `viash config inject`. This can be used to inject a Viash header into a script based on the arguments of the config file.

There have been some improvements to the Docker platform as well.  
You can now add yum packages as a requirement:

  ```yaml
  platforms:
    - type: docker
      image: bash:latest
      setup:
        - type: yum
          packages: [ wget ]
  ```

You can now include ADD and COPY instructions in the config file:

  ```yaml
  platforms:
    - type: docker
      image: bash:latest
      setup:
        - type: docker
          add: [ "http://foo.bar ." ]
  ```

## Full changelog

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `viash config`: An argument's example now needs to be of the same type as the argument itself. 
  For example, `[ type: integer, name: foo, example: 10 ]` is valid, whereas 
  `[ type: integer, name: foo, example: bar ]` is not, as 'bar' cannot be cast to an integer.

### NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `viash config inject`: A command for inserting a Viash header into your script.

* `YumRequirement`: Added a requirement setup for installing through yum. Example:
  `setup: [ [ type: yum, packages: [ wget] ] ]`

* `DockerRequirement`: Allow using copy and add instructions. Example:
  `setup: [ [ type: docker, add: [ "http://foo.bar ." ]]]`

### BUG FIXES

* `ViashTest`: Fix verbosity passthrough.

* `--help`: Fix repeated usage flag when printing the help.
