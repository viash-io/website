## Full changelog

### BUG FIXES

* `NextflowPlatform`: properly resolve paths when a nextflow workflow has another nextflow
  workflow as dependency and the worktree contains a directory that is a symlink (PR #614).

* `Main`: Fixes a bug added by #294 which causes Viash to print a stacktrace instead of a helpful error message when `viash` is run without any arguments (#617, PR #618).
  Thanks @mberacochea for pointing out this oversight!
  
* `Dependency`: When an alias is defined, pass the alias as a key to the `.run()` function (#601, PR #606).
