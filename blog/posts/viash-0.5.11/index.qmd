## What's new?

This release contains additional sugar syntax for specifying inputs and outputs in a Viash config, 
a beta implementation for the next-generation Viash platform, and several other minor improvements.

## Full changelog

### MAJOR CHANGES

* `Functionality`: Now also accepts 'inputs' and 'outputs' in addition to 'arguments'. For inputs and outputs,
  any specified arguments will have default `type: file` and `direction: input` or `direction: output` respectively.

### MINOR CHANGES

* `DockerPlatform`: Move description labels to the end of the Dockerfile to improve cross-component caching.

* `Functionality`: Arguments where `.multiple` is `true` can now have lists as `default` and `example`.

* `viash_build`: Added unit test for this component.

* `viash_test`: Added unit test for this component.

* `PythonRequirements`: Allow upgrading dependencies. Example: `[ type: python. pypi: anndata, upgrade: true ]`.

* `NextflowLegacyPlatform`: Remove annoying messages when building Nxf modules.

* `ConfigMods`: Expanded the DSL to allow specifying at which point to apply a config mod.
  This functionality was necessary to allow for setting fields which alter the way configs are parsed.
  Example of when this is useful: `<preparse> .platforms[.type == "nextflow"].variant := "vdsl3"`.
  Updating workflow of parsing a config file is:
    - read Yaml from file
    - apply preparse config mods
    - parse resulting Json as Config, thereby instantiating default values etc.
    - convert Config back to Json
    - apply postparse config mods (original config mods)
    - convert final Json back to Config

### BETA FUNCTIONALITY

* `NextflowVdsl3Platform`: A beta implementation of the next-generation Viash+Nextflow platform.
  See https://github.com/viash-io/viash/issues/82 for more information. You can access the previous Nextflow
  platform by using the `variant` parameter:
  ```yaml
  - type: nextflow
    variant: legacy
    separate_multiple_outputs: false
  ```

### BUG FIXES

* `viash_build` and `viash_test`: The `query_name` and `query_namespace` arguments were switched around. These arguments are now passed correctly.

* `BashScript`, `JavaScriptScript`, `PythonScript`, `RScript`: Correctly escape `'` (#113). Update unit tests accordingly.

* `CSharpScript`, `ScalaScript`: Correctly escape `"` (#113). Update unit tests accordingly.

* `viash_build`, `viash_test`, `viash_push`: Don't try to remove log files if they don't exist.

### INTERNAL CHANGES

* `DataObject`: 
  - Renamed `otype` to `flags`.
  - Renamed `oType` to `type`
  - Deprecated `tag` (unused feature).

* All abstract / inherited classes: Renamed `oType` to `type`.

### DEPRECATION

* `Functionality`: Deprecated `function_type` and `add_resources_to_path`. These should be 
  unused features, by now.
