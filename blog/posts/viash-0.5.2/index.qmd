## What's new?

This is a small release containing two small features and a bug fix.
The new `run_args` field allows you to add [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) arguments to the [Docker platform](/reference/config/platforms/DockerPlatform.html) section of a [config file](/reference/config/index.html). For example:

  ```yaml
  platforms:
    - type: docker
      image: bash:4.0
      run_args: "--expose 127.0.0.1:80:8080/tcp --env MY_ENV_VAR=foo"
  ```

There's also a new field for the [Nextflow platform](/reference/config/platforms/NextflowVdsl3Platform.html): `separate_multiple_outputs`. By default, this is set to `true` and separates the outputs generated by a Nextflow component with multiple outputs as separate events on the channel. You can now choose to disable this behaviour:

  ```yaml
  platforms:
    - type: nextflow
      publish: true
      separate_multiple_outputs: false
  ```

## Full changelog

### MINOR CHANGES

* `DockerPlatform`: Added `run_args` field to allow setting `docker run` arguments.

* `NextflowPlatform`: Added argument `separate_multiple_outputs` to allow not separating the outputs generated by a 
  component with multiple outputs as separate events on the channel.

### BUG FIX

* `IO`: Allow overwriting directory resources upon rebuild.
