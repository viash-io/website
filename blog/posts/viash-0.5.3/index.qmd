## What's new?

This release provides more information to scripts with the new `meta` list. This list contains two values for now:

  - `meta["resources_dir"]`: Path to the directory containing the resources
  - `meta["functionality_name"]`: Name of the component

A new environment variable is now available for export when working with the Nextflow platform: `VIASH_TEMP`.

### Resources directory

All resources defined in the config file are copied over to a temporary location right before a Viash component is executed. This location is can now be easily accessed in your scripts, allowing you to modify and copy the files as needed.  
Here are some examples in different scripting languages on how to access the meta data, it works similarly to the `par` list:

Bash:  

  ```bash
  echo $meta_resources_dir 
  ```

Python:  

  ```python
  print(meta["resources_dir"])
  ```

R:

  ```r
  cat(meta$resources_dir)
  ```

### Functionality name

The name of the component can now be accessed in the same way as the resources directory. This allows you to print the name of the component out to a console window for example.
Here's how to access this data in different scripting languages:

Bash:

  ```bash
  echo $meta_functionality_name
  ```

Python:  

  ```python
  print(meta["functionality_name"])
  ```

R:

  ```r
  cat(meta$functionality_name)
  ```

## Full changelog

### NEW FEATURES

* Similar to `par`, each script now also has a `meta` list. `meta` contains meta information about the component
  or the execution thereof. It currently has the following fields:
  - `meta["resources_dir"]`: Path to the directory containing the resources
  - `meta["functionality_name"]`: Name of the component

* `NextflowPlatform`: Export `VIASH_TEMP` environment variable. 

### BUG FIXES

* `NextflowPlatform`: Fix output formatting when `separate_multiple_outputs` is `false`.
