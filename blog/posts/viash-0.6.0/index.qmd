## What's new?

The first (major) release this year! The biggest changes are:

* Nextflow VDSL3 is now the default Nextflow platform, whereas the legacy Nextflow platform has been deprecated.

* Support for tracking memory and cpu requirements more elegantly.

* Grouping arguments in groups more concisely.

* The addition of a `viash ns exec` command, to be able to execute commands on Viash components more easily.

## Full changelog

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `NextflowPlatform`: `variant: vdsl3` is now the default NextflowPlatform. `variant: legacy` has been deprecated.

* `Functionality`: Fields `.inputs` and `.outputs` has been deprecated. Please use `.argument_groups` instead (#186).
  Before:
  ```yaml
  functionality:
    inputs:
      - name: "--foo"
    outputs:
      - name: "--bar"
  ```
  Now:
  ```yaml
  functionality:
    argument_groups:
      - name: Inputs
        arguments:
          - name: "--foo"
            type: file
      - name: Outputs
        arguments:
          - name: "--bar"
            type: file
            direction: output
  ```

* Passing strings to an argument group's arguments has been deprecated. Please simply copy the argument itself into the argument group (#186).
  Before:
  ```yaml
  functionality:
    arguments:
      - name: "--foo"
        type: file
      - name: "--bar"
        type: file
        direction: output
    argument_groups:
      - name: Inputs
        arguments: [ foo ]
      - name: Outputs
        arguments: [ bar ]
  ```
  Now:
  ```yaml
  functionality:
    argument_groups:
      - name: Inputs
        arguments:
          - name: "--foo"
            type: file
      - name: Outputs
        arguments:
          - name: "--bar"
            type: file
            direction: output
  ```

### NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* Allow setting the number of processes and memory limit from within the Viash config, 
  as well as a list of required commands. Example:

  ```yaml
  functionality:
  name: foo
  requirements:
    cpus: 10
    memory: 10GB
    commands: [ bash, r, perl ]
  ```
  
  You can override the default requirements at runtime:

  - `./foo ---cpus 4 ---memory 100PB` (for NativePlatform or DockerPlatform)
  - By adding `process.cpus = 4` and `process.memory "100 PB"` to a nextflow.config (for NextflowPlatform)

  This results the following meta variables to be injected into a script:

  - `meta_cpus` (in Bash) or `meta["cpus"]` (in any other language): Number of processes the script is allowed to spawn.
  - `meta_memory_b` (in Bash) or `meta["memory_b"]` (in any other language): Amount of memory the script is allowed to allocate, in bytes.
  - `meta_memory_kb` (in Bash) or `meta["memory_kb"]` (in any other language): Same but in kilobytes, rounded up.
  - `meta_memory_mb` (in Bash) or `meta["memory_mb"]` (in any other language): Same but in megabytes, rounded up.
  - `meta_memory_gb` (in Bash) or `meta["memory_gb"]` (in any other language): Same but in gigabytes, rounded up.
  - `meta_memory_tb` (in Bash) or `meta["memory_tb"]` (in any other language): Same but in terabytes, rounded up.
  - `meta_memory_pb` (in Bash) or `meta["memory_pb"]` (in any other language): Same but in petabytes, rounded up.
  
* `viash ns exec`: Added a command for executing arbitrary commands for all found Viash components.
  The syntax of this command is inspired by `find . -exec echo {} \;`.
  
  The following fields are automatically replaced:
   * `{}` | `{path}`: path to the config file
   * `{abs-path}`: absolute path to the config file
   * `{dir}`: path to the parent directory of the config file
   * `{abs-dir}`: absolute path to the directory of the config file
   * `{main-script}`: path to the main script (if any)
   * `{abs-main-script}`: absolute path to the main script (if any)
   * `{functionality-name}`: name of the component
  
  A command suffixed by `\;` (or nothing) will execute one command for each
  of the Viash components, whereas a command suffixed by `+` will execute one
  command for all Viash components.

* `ConfigMod`: Added a `del(...)` config mod to be able to delete a value from the yaml. Example: `del(.functionality.version)`.

### MAJOR CHANGES

* `Folder structure`: Adjusted the folder structure to correctly reflect the the namespace change of viash from `com.dataintuitive.viash` to `io.viash`.

* `Functionality`: Reworked the `enabled` field from boolean to a `status` field which can have the following statusses: `enabled`, `disabled` and `deprecated`.
  When parsing a config file which has the `status` field set to `deprecated` a warning message is displayed on stderr.
  Backwards for `enabled` is provided where `enabled: true` => `status: enabled` and `enabled: false` => `status: false`. The `enabled` field is marked deprecated.

### MINOR CHANGES

* `Resources`: Handle edge case when no resources are specified in the `vsh.yaml` config file and display a warning message.

* `BashWrapper`: Add a warning when an argument containing flags (e.g. `--foo`) is not recognized and will be handled as a positional argument as this is likely a mistake.

* `Functionality`: Add check to verify there are no double argument names or short names in the config `vsh.yaml` declarations.

* `BashWrapper`: Add check to verify a parameter isn't declared twice on the CLI, except in the case `multiple: true` is declared as then it's a valid use case.

* `BashWrapper`: For int min/max checking: use native bash functionality so there is no dependency to `bc`.
  For double min/max checking: add fallback code to use `awk` in case `bc` is not present on the system (most likely to happen when running tests in a docker container).

* `viash ns list/viash config view`: Allow viewing the post-processed argument groups by passing the `--parse_argument_groups` parameter.

### TESTING

* `ConfigMod`: Added unit tests for condition config mods.

* `MainTestDockerSuite`: Derive config alternatives from the base `vsh.yaml` instead of adding the changes in separate files.
  This both reduces file clutter and prevents having to change several files when there are updates in the config format.

* `GitTest`: Added unit tests for Git helper (#216).

### BUG FIXES

* `csharp_script`, `javascript_script`, `python_script`, `r_script`, `scala_script`: Make meta fields for `memory` and `cpus` optional.

* `NextflowVdsl3Platform`: Don't generate an error when `--publish_dir` is not defined and `-profile no_publish` is used.

* `Viash run`: Viash now properly returns the exit code from the executed script.

* `Git`: Fix incorrect metadata when git repository is empty (#216).
