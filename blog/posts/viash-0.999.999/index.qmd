## Full changelog

### MINOR CHANGES

* `viash-hub`: Change the url for viash-hub Git access to packages.viash-hub.com (PR #774).

* `RRequirements`: Allow single quotes to be used again in the `.script` field (PR #771).

* `scala`: Update Scala to Scala 3 (PR #759).
  For most of the code, this was a minor update, so no breaking changes are expected.
  The biggest change is how the exporting of the schema is done, but this has no impact on the user.
  However, switching to Scala 3 allows for additional features and improvements in the future.

### BUG FIXES

* `config build`: Fix a bug where a missing main script would cause a stack trace instead of a proper error message (PR #776).
  The error message showed the path of the missing resource but it was easy to miss given the stack trace, besides it shouldn't have been a stack trace anyway.
  
* `RRequirements`: Treat warnings as errors when installing R dependencies in Docker engines (PR #771).

* `Nextflow` runner: fix false-positive error when output argument arguments `required: true` 
  are incorrectly flagged as missing input arguments (PR #778).
