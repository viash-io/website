## What's new?

This release contains mostly minor improvements of functionality released in Viash 0.6.0. Most notably:

* Support was added for `type: long` arguments

* `meta["n_proc"]` has been renamed to `meta["cpus"]`. `meta["cpus"]` is now an integer, whereas `meta["memory_*"]` are now longs.

* `viash ns exec` is able to recognise `{platform}` and `{namespace}` fields.

* And various bug fixes and improvements to documentation and unit testing.

## Full changelog

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Deprecated usage `resources_dir` variable inside scripts, use `meta["resources_dir"]` instead (or `$meta_resources_dir` in Bash, or `meta$resources_dir` in R).

* Deprecated `meta["n_proc"]` in favour for `meta["cpus"]`.

### NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `viash ns exec`: Added two more fields:

  - `{platform}`: the platform name (if applicable)
  - `{namespace}`: the namespace of the component

* `LongArgument`: Added support for 64-bit integers with `type: long` as opposed to `type: integer` which are 32-bit integers.

### MAJOR CHANGES

* Allow passing integers/doubles/booleans to string parameters (#225). Removed the 'Version' helper class.

### MINOR CHANGES

* `meta["cpus"]` is now an integer, `meta["memory_*"]` are now longs (#224).

* `DockerPlatform`: Only store author names in the authors metadata.

* `NextflowPlatform`: Only store author names in the authors metadata.

* `Argument[_]`: Turn `multiple_sep` from `Char` into `String`.

### INTERNAL CHANGES

* All `meta[...]` variables are now processed similar to `Argument[_]`s, instead of using custom code to convert object types and detect Docker mounts.

* `Escaper`: Make more generic Escaper helper class.

### DOCUMENTATION

* Hardcoded URLs pointing to viash.io in the documentation annotations were replaced with a new keyword system.

* Replaced references to "DSL" with "Dynamic Config Modding" in the `--help` output.

* Added an example for Ruby based Docker setups.

### BUG FIXES

* `viash ns`: Reverse exit code outputs, was returning 1 when everything was OK and 0 when errors were detected (#227).

* `viash config inject`: Fix processing of arguments when argument groups are defined (#231).

* Fixed a few typos in the CLI.

* Fixed the formatting of `ns exec` documentation.

* `VDSL3`: Fix stub functionality.

* `VDSL3`: Fix error during error message.

* `viash test`: Fix issue where `VIASH_TEMP` could not be a relative directory when running `viash test` (#242).

* `BashScript`, `CSharpScript`, `JavaScriptScript`, `PythonScript`, `RScript`, `ScalaScript`: Fix quoting issues of certain characters (#113).

### DEPRECATION

* `NextflowPlatform`: Deprecate `--param_list_format` parameter.

### TESTING

* `BashScript`, `CSharpScript`, `JavaScriptScript`, `PythonScript`, `RScript`, `ScalaScript`: Implement more rigorous testing of which characters are escaped.

* `BashWrapper`: Escape usage of `multiple_sep`. This fixes various checks and transformations not working when when `multiple_sep` is set to `";"` (#235).
