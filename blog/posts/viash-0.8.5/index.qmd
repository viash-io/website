## What's new?

Fix a bug when building a test docker container which requires a test resource. Additional improvements for the website documentation and support for the latest version of Nextflow are added.

## Full changelog

### BUG FIXES

* `nextflow runner`: Fix an issue with current nextflow-latest (24.01.0-edge) where our supporting library passes a GString instead of a String and results in a type mismatch (PR #640).

* `test resources`: Make non-script test resources available during building of a docker container for `viash test` (PR #652).

### DOCUMENTATION

* `repositories`: Improve the repository documentation with links and a overview table with links (PR #643).
