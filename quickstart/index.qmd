**Viash** is your go-to script wrapper for building data pipelines from modular software components. All you need is your trusty script and a metadata file to embark on this journey.

Check out some of Viash's key features:

- Code in your [favorite scripting language](/guide/component/create-component.html). Mix and match scripting  between multiple components to suit your needs. Viash supports a wide range of languages, including Bash, Python, R, Scala, JS, and C#.
- A **custom Docker container** is auto-generated based on the dependencies you've outlined in your metadata, meaning you don't need to be a Docker expert.
- Viash also generates a **Nextflow module** from your script, so no need to be a Nextflow guru either. 
- Effortlessly combine Nextflow modules to design and run scalable, reproducible data pipelines.
- Test every component on your local workstation using the convenient built-in development kit.



## Requirements

This guide assumes you've already installed [Viash](/installation), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted).


## Quickstart example project

To get up and running fast, we provide a [template project](https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template) for you to use. It contains three components, which are combined into a Nextflow pipeline as follows:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
   A(file?.tsv) --> B[/remove_comments/]
   B --> C[/take_column/]
   C --> D[/combine_columns/]
   D --> E(output)
```

This pipeline takes one or more TSV files as input and stores its output in an output folder.

## Step 1: Get the template

First create a new repository by clicking the "Use this template" button. If you can't see the "Use this template" button, log into GitHub first.

Next, clone the repository using the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/my_first_pipeline.git && cd my_first_pipeline
```

Your new repository should contain the following files:

```bash
tree my_first_pipeline
```

    .
    ├── LICENSE.md                            License information
    ├── README.md                             A readme.
    ├── _viash.yaml                           Global Viash settings
    ├── resources_test/*.tsv                  Sample files to showcase pipeline and
    │   ├── file1.tsv                         run component unit tests.
    │   └── file2.tsv
    ├── src/demo                              Source directory with Viash components
    │   ├── combine_columns
    │   ├── remove_comments
    │   └── take_column
    └── workflows
        └── demo_pipeline                     Demo Nextflow pipeline
            ├── main.nf
            └── nextflow.config


## Step 2: Build the Viash components

With Viash you can turn the components in `src/` into Dockerized Nextflow modules by running:

```bash
viash ns build --setup cachedbuild --parallel
```
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
```{bash echo=FALSE}
viash ns build --setup cachedbuild --parallel
```
</details>

Once everything is built, a new **target** directory has been created containing the executables and modules grouped per platform:

```bash
ls -l
```
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
```{bash echo=FALSE}
ls -l
```
</details>

## Step 3: Run the pipeline

Now run the pipeline with Nextflow:

```bash
nextflow run . \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -profile docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publish_dir output
```
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
```{bash echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
nextflow run . \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -profile docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publish_dir output
```
</details>

This will run the three modules in sequence, with the final result result being stored in a file named **combined.combine_columns.output.tsv** in a new **temp** directory:

```bash
cat output/combined.combine_columns.output.tsv
```
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
```{bash echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
cat output/combined.combine_columns.output.tsv
```
</details>
