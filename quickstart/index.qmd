This guide assumes you've [installed Viash, Docker and Nextflow](/installation/) on your system. 
:::

This tutorial will guide you through using our Viash template project to run a data pipeline.

## What is Viash?

**Viash** is a script code wrapper for building modular software components that serve as building blocks to develop (Nextflow) data pipelines. All you need is your script and a metadata file to get started.  
Here are a few of Viash's key features:

- You can use your [preferred scripting language](/guide/component/languages.html) per component, and mix and match scripts between multiple components as you please. Supported languages include: Bash, Python, R, Scala, JS and C#.
- A **custom Docker container** is automatically generated based on your dependencies described in your metadata. No expert Docker knowledge is required.
- Viash generates a **Nextflow module** from your script. No expert Nextflow knowledge is required. 
- You can simply script the nextflow modules to create and run your scalable and reproducible data pipeline.
- You can test every single module on your local workstation through the built-in development kit.

## Quickstart example project

This Quickstart will take you from nothing to a scalable and reproducible [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) data pipeline. Here's the flow of the pipeline you'll be using:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
   A(file?.tsv) --> B[/remove_comments/]
   B --> C[/take_column/]
   C --> D[/combine_columns/]
   D --> E(output)
```

One or more TSV files are taken as the input and will be processed through a series of modules. At the end, the output is written away to a folder.

## Step 1: Get the template

To get up and running fast, we provide a [template project](https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template) for you to use:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Using git CLI

Run the command below to clone the template repository to a new folder named **advanced_pipeline**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template advanced_pipeline
```

## Zip download

Click the button below to download a zip file containing the template project. Once downloaded, unzip the file and rename the root directory to **advanced_pipeline**.

```{python}
create_button("https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip", "Download template", "download")
```

:::

## Step 2: Project overview

Open the **advanced_pipeline** project directory if you haven't done so already. Here's a quick overview of its contents:

- The **bin** directory contains a single script to initialize the project, more on that in the next step
- **main.nf** and **nextflow.config** are dummy files required for Nextflow to work correctly
- **README.md** contains extra information on how to use the template
- The **resources_test** directory contains two TSV files which will be used to test the example pipeline
- **src** contains three [Viash components](/guide/), each with a [config file](/reference/config/index.html) and a [script](/guide/component/languages.html)
- The **workflows** directory contains a Nextflow script and config to be able to run the pipeline

## Step 3: Use the init script 


Inside of the project is a **bin** directory containing the `init` script. This will automatically download Viash and Nextflow to that same directory.

Use the following command to run the **init** script inside of the **bin** directory:

```bash
bin/init
```

After a short while, the script will finish and the following files will be in the **bin** directory:

```
bin
├── init
├── nextflow
├── viash
├── viash_build
├── viash_install
├── viash_push
├── viash_skeleton
├── viash_test
```

These are executables needed to build, test and run the pipeline.

## Step 4: Build the Viash components

With the tools present, you can build the Docker executables and Nextflow modules using Viash. To do so, make sure Docker is running and use the following command:

```bash
bin/viash_build
```

While building, this will result in the following output:

```
In development mode with 'dev'.
Exporting remove_comments (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/remove_comments
Exporting combine_columns (demo) =docker=> target/docker/demo/combine_columns
Exporting take_column (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/take_column
Exporting take_column (demo) =docker=> target/docker/demo/take_column
Exporting remove_comments (demo) =docker=> target/docker/demo/remove_comments
Exporting combine_columns (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/combine_columns
[notice] Building container 'demo_combine_columns:dev' with Dockerfile
[notice] Building container 'demo_take_column:dev' with Dockerfile
[notice] Building container 'demo_remove_comments:dev' with Dockerfile
```

Once everything is built, a new **target** directory has been created containing the executables and modules grouped per platform:

```
target/
├── docker
│   └── demo
│       ├── combine_columns
│       │   ├── combine_columns
│       │   └── viash.yaml
│       ├── remove_comments
│       │   ├── remove_comments
│       │   └── viash.yaml
│       └── take_column
│           ├── take_column
│           └── viash.yaml
└── nextflow
    └── demo
        ├── combine_columns
        │   ├── main.nf
        │   ├── nextflow.config
        │   └── viash.yaml
        ├── remove_comments
        │   ├── main.nf
        │   ├── nextflow.config
        │   └── viash.yaml
        └── take_column
            ├── main.nf
            ├── nextflow.config
            └── viash.yaml
```

## Step 5: Run the pipeline

Now run run the pipeline with Nextflow:

```bash
bin/nextflow run . \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp
```

This will run the three modules in sequence, with the final result result being stored in a file named **combined.combine_columns.output** in a new **temp** directory:

```
"1"     0.11
"2"     0.23
"3"     0.35
"4"     0.47
```

Now that you've had a taste of what Viash can do for you, take a look at our [Guide](/guide/) and [Reference](/reference/) pages to learn more about how to use Viash. If you want to start simple, we suggest to take a look at the [Native component creation guide](/guide/component/creation/native.html).
